# RCDS-GUI

The Robust Conjugate Direction Search (RCDS) algorithm is used for tuning the accelerator to ensure maximum injection efficiency. It was developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. More details are available about it in this link: https://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacpubs/15250/slac-pub-15414.pdf. My task involves making a GUI using MATLAB App Designer as the RCDS code is written in MATLAB. The GUI is used by operators to show graphs which variables like number of iterations and effieciency achieved. The images of GUI are attached below:
